# Software Development Portfolio Website

My personal software development portfolio website to display my projects and provide career information.

## Description

I designed and built this mobile friendly, responsive project portfolio with React and Next.js. I used the combination of React and Next.js for enhanced performance with stronger SEO and UX thanks to both server side and dynamic client side rendering. I designed this website in Figma prior to building and used Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling.
